## 📡 RTL-SDR Device: Overview & Uses

RTL-SDR (RTL2832U) is a low-cost software-defined radio (SDR) that allows you to receive and analyze RF signals across a wide frequency range. It’s commonly used for:

✅ Listening to FM/AM radio, TV, and aircraft signals  
✅ Sniffing GSM, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi signals  
✅ Decoding digital signals (Pagers, ADS-B, AIS, NOAA Weather, etc.)  
✅ Penetration testing & RF security analysis

### 🔹 1. RTL-SDR Specifications

| Feature            | Details                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Chipset**       | RTL2832U + R820T2     |
| **Frequency Range** | 24 MHz – 1.7 GHz      |
| **Sampling Rate**  | Up to 2.56 MSPS       |
| **Antenna Connector** | SMA (Standard)    |
| **Modulation Types** | AM, FM, SSB, CW, DSB, QAM, FSK, PSK |

📌 **Important:** RTL-SDR cannot transmit, only receive signals.

### 🔹 2. Setting Up RTL-SDR on Linux (Dragon OS, Kali, Ubuntu)

#### Step 1: Install RTL-SDR Drivers
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install rtl-sdr gqrx gnuradio airspy
```

#### Step 2: Check if RTL-SDR is Detected
Plug in the RTL-SDR dongle and check if the system recognizes it:
```bash
lsusb | grep RTL
```
If detected, you’ll see something like:
```yaml
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0bda:2832 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL2832U
```

#### Step 3: Test RTL-SDR Reception
```bash
rtl_test -t
```
If RTL-SDR is working properly, you should see output confirming the chipset.

### 🔹 3. Using RTL-SDR for FM, TV, and ADS-B Signals

#### 🔹 Listening to FM Radio
1️⃣ Open GQRX (installed with Dragon OS):
```bash
gqrx
```
2️⃣ Select RTL-SDR as the input device.  
3️⃣ Tune to **88–108 MHz** (FM Radio Band).  
4️⃣ Click **Start** to listen to the broadcast.  

#### 🔹 Scanning for Digital TV Signals (DVB-T)
Install `w-scan` to scan available TV frequencies:
```bash
sudo apt install w-scan
w_scan -c US -ft -X
```

#### 🔹 Tracking Aircraft (ADS-B Signals)
RTL-SDR can receive ADS-B signals from airplanes (**1090 MHz**).

1️⃣ Install the `dump1090` tool:
```bash
sudo apt install dump1090
```
2️⃣ Start tracking:
```bash
dump1090 --interactive --net
```
3️⃣ Open a browser and go to:  
👉 [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see live aircraft tracking.

### 🔹 4. RF Signal Sniffing & Pentesting with RTL-SDR

#### 🔹 Sniffing GSM Traffic with GR-GSM

1️⃣ Install `grgsm`:
```bash
sudo apt install gr-osmosdr grgsm
```
2️⃣ Scan for active GSM frequencies:
```bash
grgsm_scanner
```
3️⃣ Capture live GSM packets:
```bash
grgsm_livemon -f 939.4M
```
4️⃣ Open Wireshark, filter by **gsmtap**, and analyze captured data.

#### 🔹 Sniffing IoT & Remote Control Signals (433 MHz)
Most IoT devices, remotes, and wireless sensors use **433 MHz**.

1️⃣ Open **Universal Radio Hacker (URH)**:
```bash
urh
```
2️⃣ Set the frequency to **433.92 MHz** and click **Record**.  
3️⃣ Analyze and decode the captured signal.

| Category          | Software         | Purpose                      |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Radio Listening** | GQRX, SDR#     | FM/AM Radio Reception       |
| **Signal Analysis** | GNURadio, URH  | RF Signal Decoding          |
| **GSM Sniffing** | GR-GSM, Wireshark | Capture GSM Packets        |
| **Aircraft Tracking** | dump1090     | ADS-B Signals               |
| **Weather Satellites** | NOAA APT Decoder | Decode NOAA Weather Signals |

📡 Radio Frequency (RF) Modulation & Demodulation Using SDR
This guide covers how to modulate, demodulate, transmit, and receive RF signals using Software Defined Radio (SDR).

🔹 1. Understanding Modulation & Demodulation
Modulation: Converting digital or analog data into an RF signal for transmission.
Demodulation: Extracting the original signal from the transmitted RF wave.

📌 Types of RF Modulation
Modulation Type	Description	Example Uses
AM (Amplitude Modulation)	Signal strength varies with data	AM Radio, Walkie-Talkies
FM (Frequency Modulation)	Frequency varies with data	FM Radio, Analog TV
ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)	Digital version of AM	RFID, Infrared
FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)	Digital version of FM	Bluetooth, Pager
PSK (Phase Shift Keying)	Data encoded as phase shifts	Wi-Fi, Satellite Comm
QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)	Combination of AM & PSK	Cable TV, LTE
🔹 2. Required Hardware for RF Signal Processing
To transmit & receive RF signals, you need an SDR device:

Device	Function	Frequency Range
RTL-SDR	Basic RX only SDR	24 MHz – 1.7 GHz
HackRF One	TX/RX capable SDR	1 MHz – 6 GHz
BladeRF	High-performance SDR	300 MHz – 3.8 GHz
USRP B200/B210	Advanced SDR for research	70 MHz – 6 GHz
🔹 3. Setting Up SDR Software
Install SDR Software on Linux/Windows
🔹 Install RTL-SDR Drivers:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rtl-sdr gqrx gnuradio
🔹 Install HackRF Tools:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install hackrf
🔹 Install GNURadio & GQRX:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install gnuradio gqrx
🔹 4. Receiving & Demodulating RF Signals
Step 1: Identify RF Signals Using GQRX
Open GQRX and select your SDR device.
Set frequency (e.g., 98.5 MHz for FM radio).
Observe signal peaks on the spectrum.
Use Mode Selection (AM/FM/USB/LSB) to demodulate.
Step 2: Capture & Decode RF Signals Using Universal Radio Hacker (URH)
Open URH and set frequency.
Record the signal.
Analyze waveform (ASK, FSK, PSK, etc.).
Decode the captured data.
Step 3: Decode Digital RF Signals Using GNURadio
Open GNURadio Companion.
Add RTL-SDR Source Block.
Add Demodulation Block (AM/FM/PSK/QAM).
Output to Audio Sink to hear the signal.
🔹 5. Transmitting & Modulating RF Signals
⚠️ Warning: Transmitting unauthorized signals is illegal in many countries. Always use a controlled test environment.

Step 1: Generate an RF Signal Using HackRF
Generate a test signal using hackrf_transfer:
bash
Copy
Edit
hackrf_transfer -t test.wav -f 433920000 -s 2000000
This transmits the test.wav file at 433.92 MHz.
Step 2: Modulate a Custom RF Signal Using GNURadio
Open GNURadio Companion.
Add Signal Source Block (Sine wave).
Add Modulation Block (FM Modulator).
Connect to HackRF Sink to transmit.
🔹 6. Practical RF Modulation/Demodulation Examples
Example	SDR Device	Software
Listening to FM Radio	RTL-SDR	GQRX
Sniffing & Decoding Sub-GHz Signals	RTL-SDR, HackRF	Universal Radio Hacker
Transmitting Custom RF Signal	HackRF, BladeRF	GNURadio
Recording & Replaying RF Signals	HackRF, Flipper Zero	hackrf_transfer
Decoding Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Signals	HackRF, BladeRF	Bettercap
🔹 7. Next Steps
✅ Install RTL-SDR and GQRX to start receiving signals.
✅ Use Universal Radio Hacker (URH) for decoding digital RF signals.
✅ Experiment with GNURadio to learn modulation techniques.
✅ If you need transmission capabilities, use HackRF One.
